# rende-burritobowl-emissions
Program that shows you the greenhouse gas emissions of your Burrito Bowl order at Rendezvous restaurant at UCLA. Created using Qt Creator in C++.  

**Motivation**  

**To provide a way for UCLA students to visualize the environmental impact of their food choices. The graph allows them to compare the impacts of their ingredient choices in order to make swaps or subtractions to their order to decrease its impact.  


**DEMO**  

Two demo videos are included- DEMO1 and DEMO2, showing two different bowl orders and what is displayed for each.
